## More Information

*Fiqh* is the jurisprudential science of deriving ruling from the Quran (the direct speech of Allah [God] revealed
to the final messenger: Prophet Muhammad *Peace be upon him*) and the Sunnah (the statements and actions of Prophet Muhmamad *Peace be upon him*) .
It is a comprehensive system of laws that encompasses all aspects of a Muslim's life, including worship, purification, transactions, marriage, divorce, etc.

This trivia I have built includes for Fiqh subcategories which are:
* Salah (Prayer)
* Purification
* Zakat (Charity)
* Fasting
